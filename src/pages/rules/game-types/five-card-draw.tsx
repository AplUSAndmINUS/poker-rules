      There are a few typical situations that will come up repeatedly in this game where you’re likely to be uncertain as to what’s the best thing to do. Follow these simple 5-Card Draw tips, and you’ll be fine for the most part:

      If you have just one pair, discard all three remaining cards
      With two pair, discard just the unpaired card
      When you have trips, discard both of the remaining cards
      With four-card draws, exchange the card that’s not the part of the draw
      Do not draw when you have three cards to a flush or a straight since that should go into the muck
      Even though you might be tempted to sometimes leave an extra card with your three of a kind or a pair, you’re actually reducing your chances of improving by doing so.

      These decisions have been trialed and tested, and they are mathematically your best options in given situations.

      Bluffing in 5 Card Draw: How Effective Is It?

      If there is one thing that most players recognize 5 Card Draw for, it’s bluffing. There are countless movies showing scenes where players are playing the game, and one of them goes on to pull a huge, stone-cold bluff to win a massive pot.

      In reality, though, things aren’t nearly as exciting.

      Bluffing does play an important role in Five Card Draw, but it’s not what this game is about.

      An experienced player will quickly pick up on your tendency to bluff too much and will start to look you up based on the strength of their hand.

      The amount of information you have on your opponent’s holdings in this game is quite limited. There are no shared cards, and you don’t get to see any of their down-cards. The only small piece of information you do have is the number of cards they choose to discard.

      For example, if someone is only exchanging one card, they’re likely to have a strong hand such as two pair or a four-card straight or flush draw. If you’re planning to pull a bluff, you can use this to your advantage and sometimes only take one or two cards, although you should be taking two or three.

      5 card draw strategy

      While you’re reducing your chances of improving, you’re also sending a message that you already have a hand that’s stronger than your actual holdings. Your opponents will notice this, and if you follow up on it by firing a big bet yourself or raising their bet, they might be more inclined to believe you.

      On the other hand, your bluff won’t look too credible if you discarded four cards, and now you’re barreling all of a sudden.

      It’s simply less likely that you have a big hand when you start from such a weak position.

      You shouldn’t be relying on bluffs too much in 5 Card Draw unless you have a specific player at your table that you want to target.

      If you know someone is prone to folding under pressure, you can adjust your strategy to include more bluffs against that particular opponent.

      Otherwise, stick to playing a solid game and use your bluff sparingly, which will make them look much more credible when you do decide to go for it.
